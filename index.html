<li><p>Sep., 2020 | A new journal paper <b>&lsquo;&lsquo;Towards Probabilistic Tensor Canonical Polyadic Decomposition 2.0: Automatic Tensor Rank Learning Using Generalized Hyperbolic Prior"</b> has been submitted for possible publication (available online at arXiv). </p>
<ul>
<li><p>By noticing that the performance of tensor rank learning is related to the flexibility of the prior distribution, we introduced the generalized hyperbolic prior to the probabilistic modeling of the CPD problem, based on which an inference algorithm is further developed. Extensive numerical results showed that the proposed method exhibits remarkable performance in <b>learning both low and high tensor ranks, even when the noise power is large</b>.   <br /></p>
</li>
<li><p>This is my first time working with <a href="http://cgi.di.uoa.gr/~stheodor/">Prof. Sergios Theodoridis</a>. Because of his books <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Recognition-Sergios-Theodoridis/dp/1597492728">Pattern Recognition</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Optimization-Perspective-Developers/dp/0128015225">Machine learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective</a>, I started to learn the knowledge of Bayesian learning (when I was a student). Thanks very much for his continuous education and guidance. </p>
